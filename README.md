# HW2, APES ECEN 5013 F17

All code in pdf uploaded on D2L <br />
1.Circular buffer implementation in the circ_buff folder- this has not been unit tested and is not updated. <br />
2.The Doubly Linked List implementation in the doubly_ll folder <br />
   * The test_dll.c is the driver of the all the unit tests. Do a make, and then run the executable "test_dll".
   * The Unity folder contains all the source files of the Unity testing framework.
3. The custom_call folder contains:
   * The implementation of the syscall, its makefile referenced by the kernel with returns from errno-base.h, and logging, sorting as per the requirements.
   * The modules folder contains the Makefile for the module and the custom_module.ko file.
4. The d2l folder does not contain the custom_call folder- this was an error. And has been rectified with latest submission.
